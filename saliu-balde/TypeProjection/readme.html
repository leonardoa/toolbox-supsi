            ABC DINAMO TypeProjection</h1>
        <p class="abstract">
            ABC Dinamo TypeProjection © is an innovative tool designed for testing variable type characters in a dynamic
            and interactive manner. With the convenience of your smartphone, this tool allows users to project glyphs
            directly onto a wall, providing a real-time visualization of how the characters animate and adapt to
            different surfaces. The tool is specifically crafted to showcase the versatility of variable typefaces,
            allowing designers and enthusiasts to experiment, play with and assess the visual impact of characters in various
            contexts. ABC Dinamo TypeProjection © seamlessly merges technology and typography, offering a hands-on
            experience for exploring the expressive possibilities of variable fonts on any surface.

        <h1 class="title">MIND-AR TESTING</h1>
        <p>
            First of all, I had to study and test the functionality of the Mind-AR sketch, 
            which allows you to use augmented reality from a browser. The tool allows you, 
            through predefined targets, to project images in real time on your screen.

        <h1 class="title">MOTION TYPOGRAPHY</h1>
        <p>  
            Later on, I started working on animated typography, focusing on variable fonts designed by Dinamo to fit on the big column on the university ramp.

        <video autoplay muted loop>
            <source src="src/typography_2.mp4" type="video/mp4">

        <video autoplay muted loop>
            <source src="src/typography_3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>

        <br><br> 
        <br><br> 
        <p>  
            Right after, tried over a ventilation tube.
            </p>
        
            <video autoplay muted loop>
                <source src="src/typography_4.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <video autoplay muted loop>
                <source src="src/typography_5.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <video autoplay muted loop>
                <source src="src/typography_6.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <br><br> 
            <br><br> 
            <p>  
                At this point, everything seemed to be going in the right direction; I was really getting the hang of AR. 
                However, as is often the case with coding, not everything goes smoothly. 
                A significant drawback of these amateur tools is their instability. 
                The overload of targets and projections was causing an exponential slowdown of the tool, 
                and crashes occurred frequently. For this reason, I was advised to split the targets into different 
                pages and create a proper interface... and so I did.
            </p>
            <h1 class="title">INTERFACE</h1>
            <p>  
                <p>  
                    While designing an interface, I also had to rethink the concept. 
                    Now, it's not just about a camera with an AR filter; 
                    it's a full-fledged tool capable of generating interactive paths through typography. 
                    I envisioned SUPSI as a prototype location, where users can choose specific spots to 'target.' 
                    Each target would have its unique animated font, so 5 variables in total.

                <p>  
                As we say "non tutti i mali vengono per nuocere". All the challenges have led to this point, and I am more than proud!
