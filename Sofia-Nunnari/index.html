        <p class="abstract">
            The "Anti-Target," a Creative Coding project that aims to provide users with a practical tool to avoid
            unwanted encounters &#40;such as two exes agreeing not to see each other again&#41;. Using a mix of HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, this project offers alternative route suggestions integrated with maps from MapBox, a versatile
            platform for creating customized map experiences.
            When the person you'd like to avoid is nearby, the app will send you a personalized notification with
            directions for where to "escape" in real time. <br><br>
            Unfortunately, due to github storage space limitations &#40;25 Mb&#41;, I cannot add more pictures and videos.

            This web platform shows the home page upon detection of your anti-target &#40;such as your ex&#41;.

            The red dot &#40;as seen in the image before&#41; represents your anti-target, while the white dot is your
            representation.

            By navigating the map and zoom out to get as far away from your anti-target as possible, clicking will
            display the route, duration time, and guided voice navigation.

            directions.

            Programming development, I attempted to simulate a real navigator.
            Unfortunately, MapBox does not offer car mapping navigation in the web version, so I attempted to simulate
            it and rewrite it myself by hand.
            Unfortunately since the risltato is "fake" i.e. the navigator doesn't really work since I have to manually
            set the coordinates to it &#40;instead the point of my project is that it should work automatically&#41; I had to
            delete that part and rework it.

            I tried adding a section for calculating the distance and name of the anti-target geocalization &#40;as in the
            example: your ex is at SUPSI&#41;.
            In the final version of my project I had to remove the distance section because it was not working.

        <h1 class="title">CONCLUSIONS</h1>
        <p class="caption">
            This project was very challenging, even though the time available for programming was only one week &#40;due to
            the class presentation of the project&#41;, it was creative work with its ups and downs during development.
            <br><br>
            After three days of programming I had to backtrack and reprogram the second part from scratch, it was hard
            but in the end I made it, and on the last day I was able to spend more time on the graphic design level as
            well.
            <br><br>
            Using MapBox for the first time was interesting, I wasted the first day of programming just to understand
            its documentation and use, to create small prototype maps, and to create the map style itself &#40;which I used
            in the project&#41;.
            <br><br>
            Definitely, despite the complexity of MapBox but also its limitations, I am happy that I was able to develop
            my project with this tool.
            <br><br>
            The only flaw of MapBox is the lack of GPS navigation version &#40;which it uses for cars&#41; for the web
            version. I tried to recreate it manually myself but in the end &#40;the third day announced before&#41; I had to
            recreate that part completely because it was not supposed to be fake navigation but real.
            However, this helped me to manage and learn my "problem solving" and think quickly of an alternative that
            would be good and work.
